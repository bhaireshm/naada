# Project Context & Architecture

> **IMPORTANT:** This file serves as the primary source of truth for the project's architecture, design decisions, and current state. 
> **MAINTENANCE RULE:** Any agent or developer making significant changes to the codebase **MUST** update this file to reflect those changes.

## 1. Project Overview
**Name:** Naada Music
**Description:** A personal music library application allowing users to upload, organize, and stream their music collection. It features a responsive UI, metadata enrichment via MusicBrainz, and local/cloud playback.

## 2. Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI Library:** Mantine v7 (Core, Hooks, Notifications)
- **State Management:** React Context (AudioPlayer, Search, Favorites)
- **Auth:** Firebase Authentication
- **Icons:** Tabler Icons React
- **Build Tool:** pnpm

### Backend
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **External APIs:** MusicBrainz (Metadata), Cover Art Archive
- **Storage:** Local file system / S3 (configurable)

## 3. Architecture & Key Patterns

### Frontend Layout
- **RootLayout (`app/layout.tsx`):** Server component. Wraps the app in `ThemeProvider` and `ClientLayout`.
- **ClientLayout (`components/ClientLayout.tsx`):** 
  - Acts as the main provider wrapper (`AudioPlayerProvider`, `SearchProvider`, etc.).
  - Renders `MainLayout` which contains the Mantine `AppShell`.
  - **Crucial:** The `AppShell` manages the main layout.
    - **Header:** Contains `Navigation` (Logo, Search, User Menu).
    - **Navbar:** Contains `Sidebar` (Navigation links). Collapsible on mobile.
    - **Footer:** Contains `AudioPlayer`. This ensures the player is always visible and doesn't overlap content or the sidebar.
    - **Main:** Content area with bottom padding to accommodate the footer.

### Audio Player Logic
- **State:** Managed by `GlobalAudioPlayerContext` (provides `currentSong`).
- **UI:** `AudioPlayer` component.
  - **Positioning:** Placed inside `AppShell.Footer`.
  - **Styling:** Fills the footer container (`width: 100%`, `height: 100%`). **Do NOT** use `position: fixed` on the player itself, as it breaks the AppShell layout flow.

### Backend Structure
- **Controllers:** Handle HTTP requests and response formatting. Delegate business logic to Services.
- **Services:** Contain business logic (e.g., `metadataEnrichmentService`, `songService`).
- **Models:** Mongoose schemas for data persistence.

## 4. Design System & Theme
The project uses a custom Mantine theme (`theme1`) with a "Warm Earthy" palette.

### Typography (Scaled Down)
The entire UI uses a compact scale. **Do not increase these sizes arbitrarily.**
- **Body:**
  - `xs`: 0.6rem (~9.6px)
  - `sm`: 0.7rem (~11.2px)
  - `md`: 0.8rem (~12.8px)
  - `lg`: 0.9rem (~14.4px)
  - `xl`: 1.0rem (~16px)
- **Headings:** Scaled down similarly (h1 ~1.8rem).

### Spacing & Radius
- Adjusted to match the compact typography (e.g., `xs` spacing is 0.2rem).

### Responsiveness
- **Mobile First:** Design for small screens first.
- **Header:** Uses responsive padding (`px={{ base: 'xs', sm: 'md' }}`) and gaps.
- **Sidebar:** Hidden on mobile (Burger menu toggle), fixed on desktop.

## 5. Metadata Cleaning & AI Enhancement

### Metadata Cleaner (`backend/src/utils/metadataCleaner.ts`)
The metadata cleaner provides comprehensive cleaning and normalization of song metadata from various sources (file tags, user input, downloaded files).

#### Key Features:
1. **Generic Website Pattern Removal**
   - Removes ANY website/download source in brackets using pattern matching
   - Catches domains with TLDs: `[AnySite.com]`, `[NewSite.xyz]`
   - Catches music keywords: `[MP3]`, `[320kbps]`, `[Download]`
   - Future-proof: No hardcoded site list needed

2. **Comprehensive Text Cleaning**
   - Removes bitrate info: `(320Kbps)`, `128kbps`
   - Removes quality tags: `Video Song`, `Official Audio`, `HD`, `4K`
   - Converts underscores to spaces: `Song_Name` → `Song Name`
   - Converts plus signs to commas: `Artist1+Artist2` → `Artist1, Artist2`
   - Removes special characters, emojis, control characters
   - Removes trailing junk: `Song_2` → `Song`

3. **Smart Title-Artist Separation**
   - Function: `separateTitleAndArtists()`
   - Detects patterns: `Title - Artist`, `Title by Artist`, `Title feat Artist`
   - Automatically splits combined metadata

4. **Swapped Field Detection** ⭐ NEW
   - Function: `detectAndSwapTitleArtist()`
   - Uses 6 heuristic indicators to detect when title/artist are swapped:
     - Artist starts with track number (+3 points)
     - Artist contains music words (+2 points)
     - Title has multiple names (+2 points)
     - Title has commas (+1 point)
     - Artist is longer than typical (+1 point)
     - Artist has numbers, title doesn't (+1 point)
   - Automatically swaps if score ≥ 3
   - Example: `Title: "Anirudh Nadisha Thomas"` + `Artist: "01 Song Name"` → Swapped!

5. **AI-Enhanced Metadata** (Already Integrated)
   - Service: `aiMetadataService.ts`
   - Analyzes audio characteristics (tempo, mood, energy)
   - Classifies genres using audio analysis
   - Complements text-based cleaning

#### Processing Order:
1. **Extract** metadata from file (includes AI analysis)
2. **Detect & swap** title/artist if needed (NEW)
3. **Clean** fields (remove URLs, junk, special chars)
4. **Separate** combined title-artist strings
5. **Normalize** all fields
6. **Save** to database

#### Testing & Verification:
To verify the metadata cleanup functionality, use `curl` to execute the API directly. This allows for testing both single songs and batch processing without frontend interaction.

**Example Batch Cleanup Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/songs/batch-cleanup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"processAll": true}'
```

### Delete Functionality

#### Song Deletion Features:
1. **Location 1: Song List** (`frontend/components/SongListItem.tsx`)
   - Three-dot menu → Delete option
   - Permission-based (only owner can delete)
   - Confirmation modal before deletion

2. **Location 2: Edit Modal** (`frontend/components/EditSongModal.tsx`) ⭐ NEW
   - Delete button on left side of modal footer
   - Red styling for destructive action
   - Uses `useSongActions` hook for permissions
   - Auto-closes modal after successful deletion

3. **Backend** (`backend/src/controllers/songController.ts`)
   - Verifies user permissions (403 if not owner)
   - Deletes file from R2 storage
   - Deletes from database
   - Handles errors gracefully (continues with DB deletion if R2 fails)

#### Reusable Hook:
- **`useSongActions`** (`frontend/hooks/useSongActions.ts`)
  - Provides consistent edit/delete handlers
  - Permission checking
  - Queue management
  - Used across: SongListItem, EditSongModal, AudioPlayer

## 7. Development Rules
1.  **Principles:** Adhere to **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself), **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and **SOLID** principles for all new code.
2.  **Reuse:** **ALWAYS** check for existing implementations, components, or utilities before creating new files. Reuse existing code whenever possible to avoid duplication.
3.  **Package Manager:** Always use `pnpm`.
4.  **Linting:** Fix lint errors immediately.
5.  **Build:** Always verify `pnpm build` (frontend & backend) before finishing a task.
6.  **Documentation:** Update this CONTEXT.md file when making significant changes. Do not create random `.md` files in root or `.kiro` folder unless specifically needed for implementation notes.
